# LeetCode

## Preface

I am using the [neetcode.io roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) to venture through the coding challenges, refresh my knowledge and get up to speed. I start solving them using [typeScript](./typeScript/), then revisit them to check other existing implementations and reimplement them or my own solution using [python](./python/) and [goLang](./goLang/).</br>
Further, I follow the [SQL Top 50 Route](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) to deepen my postgreSQL understanding.
